# C18: Social Media API

In this assignment, a rudamentary API has been created to demonstrate how a simple social media database would be updated via API callouts. Users can have "Thought" documents attached to them, as well as "Friends" (other users). Thoughts can in turn have "Reactions", which tie back to the User responsible for them. The database for these models is build with Mongoose and Mongodb.
